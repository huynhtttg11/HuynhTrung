@@PROJECT_NAME@@ is meant to run within the internal network of software development organizations, and this tutorial is meant to facilitate the operation of @@PROJECT_NAME@@ using **local** Docker repositories or **local** container orchestration systems (e.g., Kubernetes or OpenShift).

**Important**: Due to the current lack of an authorization concept, we do not advise to expose an instance of @@PROJECT_NAME@@ to the Internet.
