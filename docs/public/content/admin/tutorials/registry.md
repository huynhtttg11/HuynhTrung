# Push Docker images on a registry

!!! warning "Official @@PROJECT_NAME@@ images"
    @@PROJECT_NAME@@ does **not** officially publish Docker images on any public registry such as Docker Hub or Quay.io. The provided Bash script is meant to push images to **local** Docker repositories running within your organization.

## Pre-requisites

- git
- bash
- docker

## Generate @@PROJECT_NAME@@ images

In order to generate the Docker images to upload to a local registry, you should generate @@PROJECT_NAME@@'s Java archives. This can be done following the first part of the [Deploy on Docker tutorial](../docker#build-docker-images). To briefly summarize you should build and run an image which will populate your local directories with the @@PROJECT_NAME@@ JARs and WARs. In the end of this preliminary step you should have your images locally, this can be tested with the command `docker images | grep vulnerability-assessment-tool`.

## Push the images to a registry

A script was created to push the images to a local Docker registry running inside your organization. [This script](https://github.com/SAP/vulnerability-assessment-tool/blob/master/docker/push-images.sh) simply tags the images and pushes them towards the registry.

To use the script you will need:

- a registry in your organization (e.g., [goharbor/harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor))
- a username
- @@PROJECT_NAME@@ used version

Invoke the script with the following positional arguments. The script will authenticate yourself on the registry, tag your images and push them.

```sh
bash push-images.sh [registry] [username] [vulnerability-assessment-tool-version]
```

## Pulling the images from a repository

You can use Docker to pull your images from a registry.

```sh
docker pull [registry]/[username]/vulnerability-assessment-tool-rest-backend:[vulnerability-assessment-tool-version]
```
